  //Write a method printEqual with 3 parameters of type int. The method should return anything (void).
   //If one of parameters is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value"
   //If all numbers are equal print text "All numbers are equal"
   //If all numbers are different print text "All numbers are different"
   //Otherwise print "Neither all are equal or different"
   //
   //Examples of input/output
   //printEqual(1,1,1) should print text All numbers are equal
    //printEqual(1,1,2) should print text Neither all are equal or different
    //printEqual(1,-1,-1) should print text Invalid Value
    //printEqual(1,2,3) should print text All numbers are different
    
    
    
    
    
      //Playing Cat
    //The cats spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 25 and 35 (inclusive).
    //Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 45 (inclusive) instead of 35.
    //Write a method isCatPlaying that has 2 parameters. Method needs to return true if cat is playing, otherwise return false
    //1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named summer it represents if it is summer. 2nd parameter represents
    //the temperature and is of type int with the name temperature
    //
    //Examples of Input/output
    //isCatPlaying(true, 10) should return false since temperature is not in range 25 - 45
    //isCatPlaying(false, 36) should return false since temperature is not in range 25 - 35 (summer parameter is false)
    //isCatPlaying(false, 35) should return true since temperature is in range 25 - 35
