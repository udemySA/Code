   //Minutes to years and days calculator
   //write a method printYearsAndDays with parameter of type long named minutes
   //The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the years and days from the minutes parameter
   //if parameter is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value"
   //Otherwise if parameter is valid then it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YY y and ZZ d"
   //XX represents the original value minutes. YY represents the calculated years. ZZ represents the calculated days.
   //
   //Examples of input/output
   //printYearsAndDays(525600) should print "525600 min = 1 y and 0 d"
    //printYearsAndDays(1051200) should print "1051200 min = 2 y and 0 d"
    //printYearsAndDays(561600) should print "561600 min = 1 y and 25 d"
